# POWER-BI-DASHBOARD

1.**Executive Summary:**
  This project aims to develop interactive and insightful dashboards using Tableau/Power BI for
  Retail Industry Inventory Analytics Dashboard. to optimize inventory management, sales
  forecasting, and stock efficiency. The dashboards will provide real-time analytics on inventory
  levels, demand trends, and supply chain performance, enabling data-driven decision-making
  and improved operational efficiency.

2.** Problem Statement:**
  Background: If the company struggles with overstocking, stockouts, and inefficient demand
  forecasting, leading to revenue loss and operational inefficiencies.
  Objective: Build a centralized dashboard to monitor inventory turnover, optimize stock levels,
  and predict future demand across multiple store locations and product categories.
  Scope: The initial phase focuses on:
  • Inventory turnover rate & stock level trends
  • Demand forecasting based on seasonality & sales history
  • Competitor pricing analysis & impact on sales
  • Region-wise product performance & category insights


3.** Methodology:**
  1. Data Integration: Extract and merge data from internal databases and external sources
  into SQL and Tableau/Power BI.
  2. Data Cleaning & Processing: Remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and
  normalize product categories.
  3. Dashboard Design: Create interactive visualizations with KPI tracking, trend analysis,
  and forecasting models.
  4. Interactivity & User Experience: Implement filters, drill-downs, and regional
  breakdowns for detailed analysis.

  6. **Expected Outcomes:**
    1. Optimized Inventory Management: Reduce overstocking and stockouts by tracking
    real-time inventory levels.
    2. Improved Demand Forecasting: Use historical data & seasonality trends to predict
    future stock needs.
    3. Sales Performance Insights: Identify fast-moving & slow-moving products across
    regions.
    4. Competitive Pricing Strategy: Monitor competitor pricing trends and adjust product
    pricing dynamically.
    5. Enhanced Business Decision-Making: Provide automated reports & real-time
    alerts for managers.

  6. **Tools and Technologies:**
    • Tableau/Power BI for interactive dashboards & visualization.
    • SQL for data extraction, transformation & analysis.
    • Python to treat outliers
    • Excel for initial data processing & validation.

7. **Risks and Challenges:**
  • Data Quality Issues: Inconsistent data entry & missing values.
  • Integration Challenges: Ensuring seamless connection to diverse data sources.
  • Adoption & Training: Users unfamiliar with data visualization tools may require training.


9. Conclusion:
This project will empower Retail Industry Inventory Analytics Dashboard.
with actionable insights into inventory trends, demand forecasting, and pricing strategies,
leading to cost reductions, improved stock efficiency, and data-driven decision-making.
The dashboards will be tailored to business needs, ensuring a user-friendly and insightful
experience for stakeholders.
